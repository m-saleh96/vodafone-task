# VodafoneTest

This project, named VodafoneTest, follows a structured development approach, integrating various functionalities and technologies.

# Features and Implementation
- **API Integration**: Utilized an API with support for pagination and data retrieval by ID.
- **Pagination Configuration**: Initially configured the navigation bar to facilitate pagination and display data efficiently.
